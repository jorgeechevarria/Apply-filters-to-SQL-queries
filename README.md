<h1>Apply filters to SQL queries</h1>

I am responsible for ensuring the security of our organization's system. This involves investigating potential security issues and updating employee computers as needed. I utilize SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks efficiently.



<h2>Retrieve after-hours failed login attempts</h2>

I selected all tables and used ‘FROM’ to specify which table,’ WHERE’ to set my conditions to
see how many login attempts have happened after 18:00
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;
As you can see there have been 19 failed login attempts.

<h2>Retrieve login attempts on specific dates</h2>

Suspicious events occurred on 2022-05-09. and the day before 2022-05-08.
I used the OR operator and specified the dates
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
There are 75 login attempts in these 2 days.

<h2>Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico</h2>

Now I want to retrieve attempts outside of Mexico
I used NOT and LIKE operators
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';
There are 144 login attempts made outside of Mexico.

<h2>Summary</h2>

Ensuring secure data retrieval from databases is crucial, and one must employ proper SQL
query execution techniques while utilizing operators like AND, OR, and NOT to apply precise
filtering, thereby enhancing overall security measures.
